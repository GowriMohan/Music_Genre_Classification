# Music_Genre_Classification
Predicting the genre of a music track based on its audio features and other metadata.

Problem Statement: Predicting the genre of a music track based on its audio features and other metadata.

Background: Music genre classification is a fundamental problem in music information retrieval and has many practical applications such as music recommendation systems, playlist generation, and music streaming services. There are many factors that can influence the genre of a music track, such as its acoustic properties, tempo, and the characteristics of the voice(s) in the track. Additionally, metadata such as the name of the track, artist information, and musician category can also be useful in predicting the genre of a track.

Objective: The objective of this problem is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a music track, given a set of relevant features such as acousticness, danceability, energy, liveness, loudness, tempo, and other metadata.

Data: The data for this problem consists of a dataset with columns including track name, popularity, acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, voice gender, mode, speechiness, tempo, musician category, valence, and music genre.

Evaluation: The performance of the machine learning model will be evaluated using F1 score. The model will be trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on a separate test set to assess its generalization ability. The goal is to achieve high accuracy and f1 score in predicting the genre of a music track.
